## Run locally

To run the app locally, first install dependencies. I personally recomend [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), but you probably can use npm without any problem. 
To install dependencies, run the comand `yarn` or `npm install` inside mobile folder.
To start the app, just run `yarn start` or `npm start`, and follow the Expo instructions to run the app in the emulator or in any device.
